# HTML Lab
===========
This repository contains HTML-based experiments focused on exploring web markup structure, semantics, and layout concepts.

The goal of this repository is not tutorial-driven learning, but deliberate experimentation with:
- HTML structure and semantic elements
- Page organization and content hierarchy
- Markup patterns commonly used in web-based user interfaces
- Understanding how markup choices affect readability, maintainability, and rendering

The examples may evolve over time as approaches are refined or expanded.

This repository serves as a personal engineering lab for experimenting with HTML fundamentals in a structured and intentional way.
